1999-08-21 TB  Last update by Thierry Bousch to his code.

2002-01-17 CEC Discovered code on web.
            Commented everything.
            Made small code improvements.
            Reformatted for readability.
            
2002-01-19 CEC Added ability to read TIFFs and JFIF-format JPEGs.
            Added ability to extract JPEG formatted thumbnail.
            Added ability to read GPS IFD (not tested).
            Converted IFD data structure to dictionaries indexed by
            tag name.
            Factored into library returning dictionary of IFDs plus
            thumbnail, if any.
            
2002-01-20 CEC Added MakerNote processing logic.
