---------------------------- original notices -------------------------

Contains code from "exifdump.py" originally written by Thierry Bousch
<bousch@topo.math.u-psud.fr> and released into the public domain.

Updated and turned into general-purpose library by Gene Cash

Patch Contributors:
* Simon J. Gerraty <sjg@crufty.net>
s2n fix & orientation decode
* John T. Riedl <riedl@cs.umn.edu>
Added support for newer Nikon type 3 Makernote format for D70 and some
other Nikon cameras.
* Joerg Schaefer <schaeferj@gmx.net>
Fixed subtle bug when faking an EXIF header, which affected maker notes
using relative offsets, and a fix for Nikon D100.

1999-08-21 TB  Last update by Thierry Bousch to his code.

2002-01-17 CEC Discovered code on web.
            Commented everything.
            Made small code improvements.
            Reformatted for readability.

2002-01-19 CEC Added ability to read TIFFs and JFIF-format JPEGs.
            Added ability to extract JPEG formatted thumbnail.
            Added ability to read GPS IFD (not tested).
            Converted IFD data structure to dictionaries indexed by
            tag name.
            Factored into library returning dictionary of IFDs plus
            thumbnail, if any.

2002-01-20 CEC Added MakerNote processing logic.
            Added Olympus MakerNote.
            Converted data structure to single-level dictionary, avoiding
            tag name collisions by prefixing with IFD name.  This makes
            it much easier to use.
2002-01-23 CEC Trimmed nulls from end of string values.

2002-01-25 CEC Discovered JPEG thumbnail in Olympus TIFF MakerNote.

2002-01-26 CEC Added ability to extract TIFF thumbnails.

            IFD_Tag() object.

2004-02-15 CEC Finally fixed bit shift warning by converting Y to 0L.
