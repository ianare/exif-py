The recomended process is to install the `PyPI package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ExifRead>`_,
as it allows easily staying up to date.
::

    $ pip install exifread

See the `pip documentation <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ for more info.

Archive
*******
Download an archive from the project's `releases page <https://github.com/ianare/exif-py/releases>`_.

Extract and enjoy.

*****
Usage
*****

Command line
************
::

$ EXIF.py image.jpg

Show command line options::

$ EXIF.py

Python Script
*************
::

    import exifread
    # Open image file for reading (binary mode)
    f = open(path_name, 'rb')

    # Return Exif tags
    tags = exifread.process_file(f)

*Note:* if you use this library in your project as a Git submodule, you may need to do::

    from <submodule_folder> import EXIF

or::

    from <submodule_folder> import exifread

Returned tags will be a dictionary mapping names of Exif tags to their
values in the file named by path_name.
You can process the tags as you wish. In particular, you can iterate through all the tags with::

    for tag in tags.keys():
        if tag not in ('JPEGThumbnail', 'TIFFThumbnail', 'Filename', 'EXIF MakerNote'):
            print "Key: %s, value %s" % (tag, tags[tag])

An ``if`` statement is used to avoid printing out a few of the tags that tend to be long or boring.

The tags dictionary will include keys for all of the usual Exif tags, and will also include keys for
Makernotes used by some cameras, for which we have a good specification.

Note that the dictionary keys are the IFD name followed by the tag name. For example::

'EXIF DateTimeOriginal', 'Image Orientation', 'MakerNote FocusMode'


****************
Tag Descriptions
****************

Tags are divided into these main categories:

- ``Image``: information related to the main image (IFD0 of the Exif data).
- ``Thumbnail``: information related to the thumbnail image, if present (IFD1 of the Exif data).
- ``EXIF``: Exif information (Exif sub-IFD).
- ``MakerNote``: Manufacturer specific information. There are no official published references for these tags.

In some cases there is also a GPS sub-IFD.


******************
Processing Options
******************

These options can be used both in command line mode and within a script.

Faster Processing
*****************
Don't process makernote tags, don't extract the tumbnail image (if any).

Pass the ``-q`` or ``--quick`` command line arguments, or as::

    tags = exifread.process_file(f, details=False)

Stop at Given Tag
*****************
To stop processing the file after a specified tag is retrieved.

Pass the ``-t TAG`` or ``--stop-tag TAG`` argument, or as::

    tags = exifread.process_file(f, stop_tag='TAG')

where ``TAG`` is a valid tag name, ex ``'DateTimeOriginal'``.

*The two above options are useful to speed up processing of large numbers of files.*

Strict Processing
*****************
Return an error on invalid tags instead of silently ignoring.

Pass the ``-s`` or ``--strict`` argument, or as::

    tags = exifread.process_file(f, strict=True)
