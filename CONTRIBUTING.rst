Contributing
************

All contributions are welcome!

Bug reports, feature requests, bug fixes, documentation updates, sample images, etc ...
Nothing is too small or too big ;-)

Please be aware that this is a purely spare time project, so don't be offended if it
takes some time to answer.

Code Contributions
******************

Please start from the ``develop`` branch for any code or documentation contributions.
You may even find the work has already been done...

Normally the ``master`` branch is only for stable, released code.

Sample Images
*************

Sample images are very important, allowing for validating new features and limiting regressions.
On every build, the library is run on all images.

The samples are kept in the ``tests/resources`` folder.
