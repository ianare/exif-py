Thank you for helping make ExifRead / EXIF.py better.

If you are having a problem with processing an image, please provide a sample.

The sample file must be:
* in a .zip or .tar.gz archive => to avoid Github removing or altering EXIF data
* releasable under a Share-Alike license => any contributed file can be added this repository for regression testing.

Without an adequate sample we will not be able to investigate your issue.
